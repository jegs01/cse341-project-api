# CSE341 Final Project - Zoo API

This project is the final submission for the **CSE341** class at Brigham Young University - Idaho. It features a comprehensive **API** for managing data related to a Zoo, including **Animals**, **Users**, and **Staff**. The API provides full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** capabilities and follows RESTful principles.

## Project Overview

This API was developed using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. Additionally, **Swagger** has been implemented to provide detailed API documentation, and **GitHub OAuth** is used for user authentication.

### API Entities and Features

- **Zoo** - Manage zoo-specific information.
- **Animal** - CRUD operations for animal profiles and details.
- **User** - Full user management, including CRUD operations for account information.
- **Staff** - Staff management with CRUD operations to handle staff details.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - Backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express** - Web framework for building API routes and handling requests.
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Mongoose** - ODM for MongoDB to structure and interact with the data.
- **Swagger** - API documentation accessible via a dedicated URL.
- **GitHub OAuth** - Secure user authentication for login and logout functionality.

## Live URLs

- **Login** - [https://cse341-xeh0.onrender.com/login](https://cse341-xeh0.onrender.com/login)
- **Logout** - [https://cse341-xeh0.onrender.com/logout](https://cse341-xeh0.onrender.com/logout)
- **Swagger Documentation** - [https://cse341-xeh0.onrender.com/api-docs](https://cse341-xeh0.onrender.com/api-docs)

## Key Features

- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Each API entity (Zoo, Animal, User, Staff) supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
- **Authentication**: User login and logout with GitHub OAuth for secure access.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Clear, interactive API documentation to simplify testing and exploration of each endpoint.

## How to Use the API

1. **Authenticate**: Use GitHub OAuth at the login URL to access secure routes.
2. **Explore the Endpoints**: Visit the Swagger documentation to view and test the endpoints for each API entity.
3. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on Zoo, Animal, User, and Staff data directly from the API.

## About the Developer

This project was created by **Kolawole Jegede** as part of the CSE341 class requirements. It showcases skills in API development, authentication, and data management using MongoDB and Node.js.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to **Brigham Young University - Idaho** and the **CSE341 class** for the opportunity to develop and enhance these backend development skills.
